# 3 Algorithms For Forex Forecast
Forecasting Market Asset Prices Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This work focuses on developing models for forecasting market asset prices using three distinct machine learning algorithms:

1. LinearRegression: In this method, linear regression is employed to model the relationship between input data and asset prices. This approach allows for the identification of linear dependencies in the data.

2. KNeighboursRegression: The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is utilized in this approach. It relies on nearby data points to predict asset prices, making it particularly useful in cases where data exhibits non-linear relationships.

3. MLPRegression: A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is applied to forecast market asset prices. Unlike the previous methods, this algorithm can model complex non-linear data relationships.

Each of these algorithms has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method depends on the specifics of the data and the forecasting task at hand. The work includes an analysis and comparison of results obtained using each of these algorithms with the aim of identifying the most effective method for predicting market asset prices.
